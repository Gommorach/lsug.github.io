This is the official blog for the _London Scala User Group_ (LSUG).

Our goal is to bring together users of the [Scala language](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

We invite you to share your experiences, ideas, projects or knowledge.
The group organizes periodic meetings between members and occasionally guests.
You can check the upcoming events in our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/london-scala/events/).

The discussions typically take place at the group's [gitter](https://gitter.im/lsug/home).

Do you have anything to say ? Submit a talk to our [micro-CFP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UabHTXdw3EpIeT4ntqa_6OjuCc4NI81lgsNXvj3ZaO4/edit?usp=drive_web).
